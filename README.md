This repository contains different ways to interact with database. From simple CLI to colab notebook based on [WebSocket], deployed to the cluster.
All of these are **demos** and are not designed to be used in production.

## How it works

All the interactions with database is done via
```go
type Engine interface {
	Open() error
	OpenRemote(host, port string) error
	Close()
	Exec(query string) (*Table, error)
}
```
So that you can easily substitute database backend with anything you want(eg. [Aqua]).

## CLI

It's a very simle command line interface to interact with database. After you run the tool, you'll be welcomed with a prompt.
Just type the query you want to run and press enter. It will be executed on the backend, and you'll see the nicely formatted results.
To close the tool just enter `exit`.

```bash
$ go run cmd/cli/cli.go
> select * from users
   id     name   age
    1   Ruslan    21
    2     Dima    20
    3      Mat    18
```
